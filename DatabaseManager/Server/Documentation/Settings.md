## Settings

This is where you can temporary define an Azure storage account that you 
want to use for the current session. This setting will be forgotton
when you exit the web page session. You will create the Azure storage 
account in Azure. This is where you must store the PPDM data model. It 
is also used to store data access definitions, prediction sets among others,
but these are created automatically by the system.
