## Introduction
Database Manager is a platform for collaborative solutions to E&P prediction. It 
is built for the cloud generation as a DataScience Management (DSM) tool. This 
provides an effective tool to make it easier for oil and gas companies to manage
their data science projects. Predictions and data QC functions are contained in
micro services with all the rules, results and models stored in the DSM project These 
microservices you can build yourselves in C#, Python, Javascript among others.

The DSM project is based on the industry standard PPDM data model. The system has
functionality to import data from files such as LAS or csv formats, or from other
PPDM databases
